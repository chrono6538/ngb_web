# Frequently Asked Questions

## Access to my garden

We need reasonable access to the spot you have chosen for your Nordic Garden Building. If access looks tight, discuss it with the partner or show site where you place your order.

## Are the buildings secure?

Yes. We use high-specification windows, doors and locks so your possessions are well protected. We still recommend keeping high-value items out of sight where possible.

## Can I add more opening windows?

Most models have optional extras, including extra opening windows. Your local Nordic retail partner can confirm what’s possible on your chosen building.

## Can I fit blinds?

Many customers fit blinds in their buildings. We don’t specify a preferred supplier, so you’re free to use a local blinds specialist.

## Can I have electricity in the building?

Yes, but a qualified electrician must do the work. Cables can usually be routed through the base or the wall panels. Any cable entry points must be sealed correctly to prevent water ingress.

## Do I need a base for the building?

Yes. Your building must sit on a flat, level and solid base. We typically recommend a properly prepared concrete slab or similar. We’ll supply base dimensions for your specific model.

## Do I need the Nordic Eco Floor?

Yes. The Nordic Eco Floor is an integral part of the building system and we don’t supply buildings without it.

## Do I need planning permission?

Most buildings fall within current permitted development rules, but you should always check. We provide a planning permission advice pack you can download.

## Is delivery and installation included?

Our recommended retail prices include **UK mainland delivery and installation**. Your retailer can clarify what’s included for your order.
